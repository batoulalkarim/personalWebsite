          <div id="lebanon">
              <h3 id="homeHead">BEIRUT, LEBANON</h3>
              <p id="homeP">I was born in Beirut, Lebanon in 1997. I lived there for 4 years before migrating to Denver, Colorado. After living most my life in Colorado, I got the opportunity to fly back to Lebanon a few times, and see just how blessed I truly am. Life in Lebanon consists of dirt roads, electricity for only 6 hours a day, and a VERY limited supply of water. Life in America surpases the quality of life in Lebanon in an infinite amount of ways- except for one. Lebanon has an amazing sense of community. You will never see a homeless man sitting and begging for money, the community will pull together and help any human being struggling in any way they can. The sense of selflessness and overall love for humanity is something you can feel in the air when you walk down the dirt rodes of Beirut. Beirut is where my story begins. </p>

             <div id="colorado">
              <h3 id ="homeHead">DENVER, COLORADO</h3>
              <p id="homeP">Denver is where my villian origin story began. Navigating life as a young muslim girl in America was ROUGH. I wanted to live by America's social norms, not Lebanons! I acted out for attention and never focused in school. I made life really hard for myself and ended up moving out of my parents house at age 15! I hate Denver, I hate the life I had in Denver, and most of all I hate the decisions I made when I was in Denver. I only ever go out there to see my parents and go to Dentist appointments- if you haven't noticed, i'm not the biggest fan of Denver.</p>

            <div id="ship">
                <h3 id="homeHead">A CRUISE SHIP??</h3>
                <p id="homeP">Yup. I lived on a cruise ship for a few months. After highschool, I went to college for a year and absolutely hated it. I decided to take a semester off and work on a cruise ship. The ship went around the bottom right of the U.S., so I got to explore Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina! To be honest, it wasn't that special. Those states were mediocre and didn't offer much excitement- but I still got to live on a boat!</p>

        <h2 id="pageLay">PLACES IVE ENJOYED</h2>
        <div id="california">
            <h3 id="homeHead">SF, CALIFORNIA</h3>
            <p id="homeP">Ahhhh, my home away from home! I lived all over the Bay Area for three years. I absolutely loved spending my early twenties in San Francisco! I met amazing people, went to college for Fine Arts at the Academy Of Arts University, created life-long friendships, and developed as an individual in the best ways possible. I worked in the restaurant industry and made a handful of friends in the tech industry, that had a hand in leading me to Software Engineering!</p>
        </div>
        <div id="chicago">
            <h3 id="homeHead">CHICAGO, ILLINOIS</h3>
            <p id="homeP">I only lived in Chicago for about 6 months and it was in winter- so I wasn't really able to really experience the coulture as much as I would have liked; however, I did the basic-touresty things people do and L O V E D meeting the artistic community out there. I absolutely loved life in Chicago minus the cold weather and rude people I managed to encounter.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="nyc">
            <h3 id="homeHead">NYC</h3>
            <p id="homeP">And finally, I have lived in NYC and still do. I moved to NY after the initial pandemeic lockdown because my sister had been living in Manhattan for the past seven years. I decided it was time to try something new and see if I would like life out in the big city! Turns out I loved it!! I met more people in the tech space and they encouraged me to take up coding as a hobby.<strong><em>I. Loved. It.</em></strong> Problem solving and creating something like a website made me feel accomplished, so I continued to pursue it. Fast forward 7 months, I'm now preparing to begin my Software Engineering Bootcamp at Flatiron School, and creating this very website as my final project for my pre-work. New York has been really good to me, and I am so blessed to be who and where I am. </p>
